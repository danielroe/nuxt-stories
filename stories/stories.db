It will only be enabled if your environment is development OR if you specify `forceBuild: true`. There might be times where you want to host the app as a static site so that you can also share the stories. However, normally in production, you probably wouldn't want to package them.\n\n```js\n...\nbuildModules: [\n  [ 'nuxt-stories', { forceBuild: false } ]\n]\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also specify the stories options separately:\n```js\n...\nbuildModules: ['nuxt-stories'],\nstories: { /* stories options here */ }\n...\n```\n\n## Options\n\n| option | description | default |\n|---|---|---|\n| `forceBuild` | Force the creation of story routes | false |\n| `lang` | stories language | 'en' |\n| `storiesDir` | Stories Directory | 'stories' |\n| `storiesAnchor` | Stories Route Root | `storiesDir` value |\n| `codeStyle` | [Code style](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/) to be used by highlight.js in markdown | 'darcula'\n| ioOpts | socket.io options | See below |\n| staticHost | static host options | See below |\n\n### IO Options\n\nBy default, if a static host is not specified, the nuxt-stories module will start a socket.io server and will add special \"nuxtStories\" socket.io client when your app starts up. The IO server is used to respond requests from the client to perform the following actions:\n\n- Add story\n- Rename story\n- Remove story\n- Fetch story\n- Fetch all stories\n- Saving markdown-based story\n\nThe CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) features only work properly for Markdown-first stories. They haven't been designed to work for Vue-first stories, and it is not planned to support Vue-first, since I think most users will go with Markdown-first.\n\nThe IO options takes the following options:\n\n| option | description | default |\n|---|---|---|\n| host | socket.io hostname | Nuxt app's hostname (localhost) |\n| port | socket.io port | Nuxt app's port + 1 (3001) |\n| url | socket.io url | undefined |\n\nIf you provide the socket.io url, any provided host or port will be ignored. The url provided will be used.\n\nThere is no need to specify the socket.io client. Under the hood, the nuxt-stories module will register the IO server and know how to auto setup the socket.io client using nuxt-socket-io. \n\nWhen the IO options are used, the CRUD operations will be accessed in a dropdown that appears when you hover over the stories, but always hidden if a static host were specified (see next sections)\n\n### Static Host Options\n\nIf the `staticHost` options are truthy, all socket.io features will not be registered. This can be useful if you wish to create documents that you don't want others to change; i.e., you want the content to be *static* (and unchanged). Therefore, if staticHost is truthy, all the CRUD features for stories won't be registered, and when you hover over the stories in the sidebar, no CRUD dropdown will appear (as designed). \n\nThe following are options for the static host: (pick one)\n\n| option | description | default |\n|---|---|---|\n| mount | the static mount point for stories | '/markdown' |\n| url | api endpoint for stories | undefined | \n\nThe mount point or the url is where you expect the stories to be. It'll either be at:\n\n1. [your host][mount]/stories.json\n\nor\n\n2. [your url] // some url that returns stories JSON.\n\nYou can either specify the mount point or the url. If you specify both, the url will be used. \n But, by default, if `staticHost` is truthy (i.e., in the simplest form `true`), then the mount point will be '/markdown'. This mount point will statically serve the content in your stories directory (\"stories\" by default). \n\nIf you are using the defaults, the nuxt-stories module will automatically scan your stories directory to build the following stories.json file that can then easily be fetched:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"en\": {\n    name: 'stories'\n    path: '...',\n    children: [...]\n  },\n  \"es\": {\n    name: 'stories'\n    path: '...',\n    children: [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt's simply a JSON grouped by language. This file in [stories directory] will then be accessible at [mount point]: '/markdown/stories.json'. \n\nIf instead of providing a mount point, you provide a url that is something completely external (and out of your control), you just need to make sure that url provides stories.json in the correct format:\n\n```js\n{ \n  [language]: Story\n}\n```\n\nWhere each story has a schema:\n\n```js\n{\n  name: String, /* Story name */\n  path: String, /* Route path */\n  idxs: [Number], /* Array of idxs that trace to this story (see below) */\n  mdPath: String /* Story's relative markdown path */\n  children: [Story]\n}\n```\n\nThe idxs help make it easier to navigate to each story, even after changing the order on the UI. For example, consider the following tree:\n\n* story 1\n  * child 1\n* story 2\n  * child 1\n\nStory 1's \"child1\" would have idxs [0, 0], whereas story 2's \"child1\" would have idxs [1, 0]. Then, if the UI were after to change the order of the stories, it'd be easy to refer to the right \"child1\" by using those idxs.\n\n\n\n","toc":[{"type":"heading","raw":"## Configuration\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Configuration","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Configuration","text":"Configuration"}],"href":"#configuration"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Options\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Options","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Options","text":"Options"}],"href":"#options"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### IO Options\n\n","depth":3,"text":"IO Options","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"IO Options","text":"IO Options"}],"href":"#io-options"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### Static Host Options\n\n","depth":3,"text":"Static Host Options","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Static Host Options","text":"Static Host Options"}],"href":"#static-host-options"}],"md":"\n## Configuration\n\nIn your `nuxt.config.js` file, just specify `nuxt-stories` as one of your `buildModules`.

The IO server is used to respond requests from the client to perform the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add story</li>\n<li>Rename story</li>\n<li>Remove story</li>\n<li>Fetch story</li>\n<li>Fetch all stories</li>\n<li>Saving markdown-based story</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) features only work properly for Markdown-first stories.

Under the hood, the nuxt-stories module will register the IO server and know how to auto setup the socket.io client using nuxt-socket-io. </p>\n<p>When the IO options are used, the CRUD operations will be accessed in a dropdown that appears when you hover over the stories, but always hidden if a static host were specified (see next sections)</p>\n<h3 id=\"static-host-options\">Static Host Options</h3>\n<p>If the <code>staticHost</code> options are truthy, all socket.io features will not be registered.

If you specify both, the url will be used. \n But, by default, if <code>staticHost</code> is truthy (i.e., in the simplest form <code>true</code>), then the mount point will be &#39;/markdown&#39;. This mount point will statically serve the content in your stories directory (&quot;stories&quot; by default). </p>\n<p>If you are using the defaults, the nuxt-stories module will automatically scan your stories directory to build the following stories.json file that can then easily be fetched:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js hljs\">{\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;en&quot;</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;stories&#x27;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">path</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;...&#x27;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">children</span>: [...]\n  },\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;es&quot;</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;stories&#x27;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">path</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;...&#x27;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">children</span>: [...]\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>It&#39;s simply a JSON grouped by language.

It will respect two properties \"fetch\" and \"nodeFetch\" in the frontMatter. The syntax for both is identical, with the main difference being *where* the fetch is initiated: client or server.\n\nIn addition to fetching data, the feature also allows you to instantly parse the data and redirect the fetched to browser storage depending on the syntax you provide.\n\nThe most basic format is this:\n\n```html\n---\n  fetch:\n    [prop1]: [path or url] [| format?] [> [dest?]]\n  nodeFetch:\n    [prop2]: [path or url] [| format?] [> [dest?]]\n---\n```\n\nThe results will be merged into a property \"fetched\" that will contain the responses. The response will also be stored in vuex so other stories can easily access it.\n\nThe supported formats are: \n* text - default\n* csv \n* json\n* xml\n\nThe supported destinations are:\n* localStorage (alias \"lS\")\n* sessionStorage (alias \"sS\")\n\n## Fetch example\n\nIn this story, the frontMatter contains:\n```html\n  fetch: \n    csv: /someFile.csv | csv\n    someJson: /someJson.json | json > lS\n```\n\nTo analyze this line-by-line, this means to:\n\n1. Fetch \"/someFile.csv\", then parse the response as csv (with the \"| csv\") and store the json result in this component's fetched (`this.fetched.csv`).\nHere is the response: \n\n> Input: {{ fetched.csvIn }}\n\n> Output: {{ fetched.csv }}\n\n2. Fetch \"/someJson.json\", then parse the response as json (with the \"| json\"), store the json result in `this.fetched.someJson` and then also send that response to localStorage (with the \"> lS\", using the alias):\n\n> Input: {{ fetched.someJsonIn }}\n\n> Output: {{ fetched.someJson }}\n\n> Also stored in: (remove ticks to see it)\n\n`{{` localStorage.fetched[$route.path] `}}`\n\n## Node fetch example\n\nNOTE: this only works with a running server. I.e., it won't work on static deploys.\n\nThis story's frontMatter also contains the following nodeFetch entries:\n\n```html\n  nodeFetch:\n    someJson2: /someJson.json | json > sS\n```\n\nIt is important to note that the responses from both `fetch` and `nodeFetch` get merged into a single `this.fetched` object, so the property names need to be unique. Since `fetch` already specified \"someJson\", we can't re-use that in `nodeFetch`. We have to give it a unique name, for example \"someJson2\".\n\nIn this example, it's very similar to the one before, but instead of sending the response to localStorage, we send it to sessionStorage (using the alias \"sS\").\n\n> You can see it below: (remove tick marks)\n\n`{{` sessionStorage.fetched `}}`\n\nAlso, as a convenience to the user, while node-fetch normally requires the hostname to be provided, the nuxt-stories plugin handles this for you. If you provide relative path, it will prepend `window.location.origin` to satisfy node-fetch's requirement.\n\n## Parametric fetch\n\nThere are times when the routes are parametric. I.e., `/path/to/search?id=:productId&count=:count`\n\nThere are also times where the parameters to provide are not defined on the component, but are defined in environment variables, such as API keys: `/getData?apiKey=$API_KEY`\n\nThe nuxt-stories module supports both kinds of routes. Consider the following frontMatter:\n\n```html\n---\n  productId: 123\n  count: 5\n  fetch:\n    list: /path/to/search?id=:productId&count=:count\n  nodeFetch:\n    myResp: /myData?apiKey=$API_KEY\n---\n```\n\nThe following will take place:\n1. On the client, \":productId\" and \":count\" will be replaced by this component's `productId` and `count`, respectively. So the fetch request will go to: `/path/to/search?id=123&count=5`. The result will be stored in `this.list`\n\n2. On the server, \"$API_KEY\" will be replaced by process.env[API_KEY], and so that environment variable will need to be defined when the server is running. The fetch will request `/myData?apiKey=[process.env[API_KEY]]` and the result will also stored in `this.myResp`.\n\n## Fetching with Options\n\nThis module also allows [fetch options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#parameters) to be wired to the underlying fetch API using the property `fetchOpts` in the frontMatter. There are times where certain resources require HTTP headers to also be sent with the request. This is where fetchOpts comes into play:\n\n```html\n  fetch:\n    resp1: somehost.com/path/needs/opts\n    resp2: somehost.com/path/also/needs/opts\n    resp3: someOtherHost.com/needs/opts\n  fetchOpts:\n    resp1: \n      headers:\n        cookie: abc123\n    resp2: \n      headers:\n        cookie: abc123\n    resp3:\n      mode: no-cors\n```  \n\nThe fetchOpts needs to have the same property names as the fetch or nodeFetch objects, so that the module knows what option set to send to a specific route. So, in the snippet above, the fetchOpts would get sent to each route. `someHost.com` would get the cookie \"abc123\", whereas `someOtherHost.com` would receive no cookies, the fetch API would consume the \"mode: no-cors\" options for that endpoint.\n\nThe above can get quite tedious to write, so as an initial convenience, option sets can be aliased with a string prefixed with \":\" like this:\n\n```html\n  someHostOpts:\n    headers:\n      cookie: abc123\n  fetch:\n    resp1: somehost.com/path/needs/opts\n    resp2: somehost.com/path/also/needs/opts\n    resp3: someOtherHost.com/needs/opts\n  fetchOpts:\n    resp1: \":someHostOpts\"\n    resp2: \":someHostOpts\"\n    resp3:\n      mode: no-cors\n``` \n\nHere, `someHostOpts` is now defined on the component and can be re-used with \":someHostOpts\" in the \"fetchOpts\" frontMatter.\n\n## Accessing from Vuex\n\nAs mentioned before, all the responses are contained in this components `this.fetched` object. This actually is a computed property, which simply pulls from the Vuex store, keying off the current route `$route.path`. Therefore, if any other story needs to access what was fetched in one story, it can with `$store.state.$nuxtStories.fetched[story relative path]`:\n\n{{ $store.state.$nuxtStories.fetched }}","toc":[{"type":"heading","raw":"# Fetching Data\n\n","depth":1,"text":"Fetching Data","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Fetching Data","text":"Fetching Data"}],"href":"#fetching-data"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Fetch example\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Fetch example","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Fetch example","text":"Fetch example"}],"href":"#fetch-example"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Node fetch example\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Node fetch example","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Node fetch example","text":"Node fetch example"}],"href":"#node-fetch-example"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Parametric fetch\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Parametric fetch","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Parametric fetch","text":"Parametric fetch"}],"href":"#parametric-fetch"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Fetching with Options\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Fetching with Options","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Fetching with Options","text":"Fetching with Options"}],"href":"#fetching-with-options"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Accessing from Vuex\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Accessing from Vuex","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Accessing from Vuex","text":"Accessing from Vuex"}],"href":"#accessing-from-vuex"}],"md":"\n# Fetching Data\n\nA special fetch feature is introduced and enabled by default in v2.0.13 of nuxt-stories.

Fetch \"/someJson.json\", then parse the response as json (with the \"| json\"), store the json result in `this.fetched.someJson` and then also send that response to localStorage (with the \"> lS\", using the alias):\n\n> Input: {{ fetched.someJsonIn }}\n\n> Output: {{ fetched.someJson }}\n\n> Also stored in: (remove ticks to see it)\n\n`{{` localStorage.fetched[$route.path] `}}`\n\n## Node fetch example\n\nNOTE: this only works with a running server. I.e., it won't work on static deploys.\n\nThis story's frontMatter also contains the following nodeFetch entries:\n\n```html\n  nodeFetch:\n    someJson2: /someJson.json | json > sS\n```\n\nIt is important to note that the responses from both `fetch` and `nodeFetch` get merged into a single `this.fetched` object, so the property names need to be unique. Since `fetch` already specified \"someJson\", we can't re-use that in `nodeFetch`. We have to give it a unique name, for example \"someJson2\".\n\nIn this example, it's very similar to the one before, but instead of sending the response to localStorage, we send it to sessionStorage (using the alias \"sS\").\n\n> You can see it below: (remove tick marks)\n\n`{{` sessionStorage.fetched `}}`\n\nAlso, as a convenience to the user, while node-fetch normally requires the hostname to be provided, the nuxt-stories plugin handles this for you. If you provide relative path, it will prepend `window.location.origin` to satisfy node-fetch's requirement.\n\n## Parametric fetch\n\nThere are times when the routes are parametric. I.e., `/path/to/search?id=:productId&count=:count`\n\nThere are also times where the parameters to provide are not defined on the component, but are defined in environment variables, such as API keys: `/getData?apiKey=$API_KEY`\n\nThe nuxt-stories module supports both kinds of routes. Consider the following frontMatter:\n\n```html\n---\n  productId: 123\n  count: 5\n  fetch:\n    list: /path/to/search?id=:productId&count=:count\n  nodeFetch:\n    myResp: /myData?apiKey=$API_KEY\n---\n```\n\nThe following will take place:\n1. On the client, \":productId\" and \":count\" will be replaced by this component's `productId` and `count`, respectively. So the fetch request will go to: `/path/to/search?id=123&count=5`. The result will be stored in `this.list`\n\n2. On the server, \"$API_KEY\" will be replaced by process.env[API_KEY], and so that environment variable will need to be defined when the server is running. The fetch will request `/myData?apiKey=[process.env[API_KEY]]` and the result will also stored in `this.myResp`.\n\n## Fetching with Options\n\nThis module also allows [fetch options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#parameters) to be wired to the underlying fetch API using the property `fetchOpts` in the frontMatter. There are times where certain resources require HTTP headers to also be sent with the request. This is where fetchOpts comes into play:\n\n```html\n  fetch:\n    resp1: somehost.com/path/needs/opts\n    resp2: somehost.com/path/also/needs/opts\n    resp3: someOtherHost.com/needs/opts\n  fetchOpts:\n    resp1: \n      headers:\n        cookie: abc123\n    resp2: \n      headers:\n        cookie: abc123\n    resp3:\n      mode: no-cors\n```  \n\nThe fetchOpts needs to have the same property names as the fetch or nodeFetch objects, so that the module knows what option set to send to a specific route. So, in the snippet above, the fetchOpts would get sent to each route. `someHost.com` would get the cookie \"abc123\", whereas `someOtherHost.com` would receive no cookies, the fetch API would consume the \"mode: no-cors\" options for that endpoint.\n\nThe above can get quite tedious to write, so as an initial convenience, option sets can be aliased with a string prefixed with \":\" like this:\n\n```html\n  someHostOpts:\n    headers:\n      cookie: abc123\n  fetch:\n    resp1: somehost.com/path/needs/opts\n    resp2: somehost.com/path/also/needs/opts\n    resp3: someOtherHost.com/needs/opts\n  fetchOpts:\n    resp1: \":someHostOpts\"\n    resp2: \":someHostOpts\"\n    resp3:\n      mode: no-cors\n``` \n\nHere, `someHostOpts` is now defined on the component and can be re-used with \":someHostOpts\" in the \"fetchOpts\" frontMatter.\n\n## Accessing from Vuex\n\nAs mentioned before, all the responses are contained in this components `this.fetched` object. This actually is a computed property, which simply pulls from the Vuex store, keying off the current route `$route.path`. Therefore, if any other story needs to access what was fetched in one story, it can with `$store.state.$nuxtStories.fetched[story relative path]`:\n\n{{ $store.state.$nuxtStories.fetched }}","compiled":"<h1 id=\"fetching-data\">Fetching Data</h1>\n<p>A special fetch feature is introduced and enabled by default in v2.0.13 of nuxt-stories.

Since storybooking is something I would plan to do for all professional projects, I can&#39;t afford to spend too much time fighting the tool and redoing configs. Plus, if I happened to be super smart and figure the config out once, good luck if I could remember all those steps for the next project several months later.</li>\n<li>The AH HA moment! NUXT <em>already</em> provides you all the tools you need to build a storybook quickly that works alongside your app really nicely! Just EXTEND THE ROUTES when in dev mode only! Then just navigate to those routes! EASY!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"nuxt-stories-vs-nuxt-content\">nuxt-stories vs. nuxt-content</h2>\n<p>These two are very similar, but address different problems. The focus of this module is to primarily a <em>developer tool</em> for rapid writing of stories. These stories are meant to serve as clearly documenting project requirements for a web app. Therefore, included in this module is the ability to rapidly compile Vue components <em>as you type</em> them on the stories UI. Quickly change the properties to see how the components change.</p>\n<p>Nuxt content is also a very awesome module, but my understanding is it serves a slightly different purpose: to make writing static content (such as blog posts) much easier. In fact, I use it to write nuxt-socket-io docs and love a lot of things about it and may plan to carry some ideas over to this project! Nuxt content is also styled using Tailwind, whereas nuxt-stories uses Bootstrap. So the developer has options. </p>\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Introduction","order":1},"meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1638751982784},"$loki":6},{"file":"/home/richies444/Software/nuxt-stories/stories/en/Documentation/Usage.md","lang":"en","labels":["Documentation","Usage"],"href":"/stories/en/Documentation/Usage","parent":"/stories/en/Documentation","children":[],"content":"---\ntitle: Usage\norder: 3\n---\n\n# Usage\n\nAfter you first install `nuxt-stories`, remember a postinstall script will run to gently copy over the following:\n\n* stories to \"stories\" dir\n* stories layout \"stories\" to \"layouts\" dir\n* stories assets (css/scss/svg) to your \"assets\" dir\n\nIf a \"components\" directory does not already exist, it will be created in your project root.\n\n### Try it!\n\nClick the \"split\" button above and watch your changes asap!\n\nWrite some markdown:\n* item 1\n* item 2\n\nWrite a vue component:\n<stories-logo />\n\nSee compilation in action, by removing the tick marks below:\n`<stories-logo />`\n\n## Folder structure\n\nStories are organized in a similar fashion as your Nuxt *pages*, since the same \"createRoutes()\" function is used. Specifically, the structure is as follows:\n\n- [app root]/\n  - [`storiesDir`; default: \"stories\"]\n    - [`lang`; default: \"en\"]\n      - index.vue // stories root. don't change...\n      - index // folder to contain the children\"\n\nInside of the \"index\" folder is where you really maintain your stories. You have two approaches for writing stories: 1) Vue-in-Markdown (new way), and 2) Markdown-in-Vue (legacy) and 3) Rough combination of the two. These docs are using the new way, and, in my opinion, make life far easier. The legacy way still exists in case you need it.\n\nTo see that everything got setup correctly, you should be able to see the sample stories at: http://localhost:3000/stories (default).\n\nWhenever in doubt, just look at this github repo! These hosted docs use that directly so you know the repo will have working code!\n\n### Markdown-first / Vue-in-Markdown\n\nThis approach means the stories will take a \"Markdown first\", which I think is extremely powerful. Markdown, in my opinion, is a format that allows one to *write* ideas much faster than *markup*. It feels more natural, but we still want to see compiled *markup* because it's, cleaner, visually appealing, and functional. Plus, with \"Markdown first\", we can write *frontmatter* and then use that data for our Vue components really easily. \n\nHere's how to do with the module. Drilling down into the \"index\" folder, the structure looks like this:\n\n- story1.md // md file\n- story2.md // md file\n- story2 // folder, if story2 has children\n  - child1.md \n  - child2.md  \n\nFrom this, the following routes will be extended from your existing app routes:\n- /stories/story1\n- /stories/story2\n- /stories/story2/child1\n- /stories/story2/child2\n\nAt any time you need to change the ordering of the stories, you do so by defining the \"order\" property in the markdown (scroll to the top of this story \"Usage\" in \"edit mode\" to see how the frontmatter is formatted). \n\n### Vue-first / Markdown-in-Vue\n\nIt's possible you will want a \"Vue-first\" approach instead to writing your stories, since you will have more control over styling.\n\nThe folder structure is very similar to the previous approach:\n\n- story1.vue // vue file\n- story2.vue // vue file\n- story2 // folder, if story2 has children\n  - child1.vue \n  - child2.vue  \n\nFrom this, the following routes will be extended from your existing app routes (just like before):\n- /stories/story1\n- /stories/story2\n- /stories/story2/child1\n- /stories/story2/child2\n\nHowever, since you are now creating your stories the same way you create your Nuxt pages (i.e., \"Vue first\"), it now lies on you to include the `<nuxt-child></nuxt-child>` wherever you plan to have to story children! So, in the above example, story2.vue would need to have the nuxt child tag. In my opinion, this is not a development experience I enjoy, but if you're used to it, you might not mind it.\n\nAs of version >= 1.0.2, a markdown wrapper component ships with the package that makes it easy to compile markdown. To use it, just wrap any of your stories with the `<markdown></markdown>`. For example:\n\n```html\n<markdown>\n  # This is a heading\n\n  ## This is a sub-heading\n\n  ### Here are some bullets:\n\n  * Bullet 1\n  * Bullet 2\n\n  ### Here is a component:\n\n  (You can specify the Vue component just like you normally do!)\n  <logo></logo>\n\n  Text can be bolded with HTML ```<b></b>``` tags: <b>BOLD</b> text\n\n  Or we can use markdown with double asterisks: **BOLD** text\n</markdown>\n```\n\n## Using the UI\n\n### Some notes\nFirst understand, with the current UI, there are some features that have been implemented, others that are simply acting as placeholders: the search box, language selector, user selector are all just placeholders. Everything else is operational to spec.\n\nAlso note, at the top, the stories header contains toggle buttons for selecting the view mode of the stories: \"view\" / \"edit\" / \"split\". These buttons only work for the \"Markdown-first\" stories, and there is no plan to make them work for the old way. The toggle button was inspired by h-wiki's front end.\n\nFor the editing feature to work, the Nuxt app has to have the server running, since nuxt-stories will make api calls to the server-side code (so that the changes can be made back to your filesystem). \n\n### Write your first story\n\nAgain, live-editing on the UI only works for the \".md\" files. For the \".vue\" files, you have to edit those in your IDE. \n\nClick on any of the \".md\" stories and toggle the view mode to either \"edit\" or \"split\" if you want to see the changes right away. If you are on your local machine running in dev mode, you'll see the changes also getting saved back to your filesystem. In VS code for example, you should actually see the code changes *instantly*. \n\nYou can try writing markdown or vue-in-markdown to see it in action:\n\nFor example, here is a list:\n* item 1\n* item 2\n\nAnd here is a the nuxt-stories logo:\n<stories-logo /> ... tada!\n\n### Important notes\n\n1. At any time you wish to pause the instant compilation, simply switch to \"edit mode\" by clicking the pencil icon in the top togglebar. Clicking back to either \"split\" or \"view\" mode will re-enable the instant compilation.\n1. Since the UI is allowing you to do live editing and real-time compiling, there is technically a lot of rule-breaking going on, but it's ok, because this is simply a *dev tool* primarily used *locally*. Expect to see console log statements going haywire. As you type, naturally, compilation will fail as the component name is incomplete. My best recommendation is to temporarily mute console errors, or disable the \"error\" log level in dev tools.\n1. The table-of-contents on the right only gets updated for \"Markdown first\" stories. \n1. The table-of-contents \"scrollspy\" feature that highlights the actively viewed story works primarily in \"view\" mode. \n1. To get code syntax highlighting to work, don't forget to include the code language\n identifier:\n\nHighlighted (with \"js\"):\n```js\nvar str = \"Hi, I'm highlighted :)\"\n```\n\nNot highlighted:\n```\nvar str = \"Hi, I'm not highlighted :(\"\n```\n\nAnd lastly, at any time you don't like the UI...it's ok! You're a developer and you're not locked in to using my design! You can tweak it as you need!\n1. dompurify is included as a dependency, but is commented out in the markdown utils since it interferes with the live-editing. This shouldn't be an issue for local development purposes only. You may wish to uncomment the lines in the utility if you think you'll need to sanitize the input.\n\n","toc":[{"type":"heading","raw":"# Usage\n\n","depth":1,"text":"Usage","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Usage","text":"Usage"}],"href":"#usage"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### Try it!\n\n","depth":3,"text":"Try it!","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Try it!","text":"Try it!"}],"href":"#try-it"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Folder structure\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Folder structure","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Folder structure","text":"Folder structure"}],"href":"#folder-structure"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### Markdown-first / Vue-in-Markdown\n\n","depth":3,"text":"Markdown-first / Vue-in-Markdown","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Markdown-first / Vue-in-Markdown","text":"Markdown-first / Vue-in-Markdown"}],"href":"#markdownfirst--vueinmarkdown"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### Vue-first / Markdown-in-Vue\n\n","depth":3,"text":"Vue-first / Markdown-in-Vue","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Vue-first / Markdown-in-Vue","text":"Vue-first / Markdown-in-Vue"}],"href":"#vuefirst--markdowninvue"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Using the UI\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Using the UI","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Using the UI","text":"Using the UI"}],"href":"#using-the-ui"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### Some notes\n","depth":3,"text":"Some notes","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Some notes","text":"Some notes"}],"href":"#some-notes"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### Write your first story\n\n","depth":3,"text":"Write your first story","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Write your first story","text":"Write your first story"}],"href":"#write-your-first-story"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### Important notes\n\n","depth":3,"text":"Important notes","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Important notes","text":"Important notes"}],"href":"#important-notes"}],"md":"\n# Usage\n\nAfter you first install `nuxt-stories`, remember a postinstall script will run to gently copy over the following:\n\n* stories to \"stories\" dir\n* stories layout \"stories\" to \"layouts\" dir\n* stories assets (css/scss/svg) to your \"assets\" dir\n\nIf a \"components\" directory does not already exist, it will be created in your project root.\n\n### Try it!\n\nClick the \"split\" button above and watch your changes asap!\n\nWrite some markdown:\n* item 1\n* item 2\n\nWrite a vue component:\n<stories-logo />\n\nSee compilation in action, by removing the tick marks below:\n`<stories-logo />`\n\n## Folder structure\n\nStories are organized in a similar fashion as your Nuxt *pages*, since the same \"createRoutes()\" function is used.

To import ES modules (.mjs or .js files that use the ESM syntax), the `frontMatter.esm` property needs to be defined and formatted as an array of either URLs or importName-to-URL map entry.

If the entry is an importName-to-URL map, then the named imports will be imported from the specified URL, provided the module at that URL exports those names. Again, if \"as [alias]\" is provided, the import will be available to work with as that alias. \n\nAll the fetching is performed in Nuxt's fetch hook, so it's advised to check `$fetchState.pending` before attempting to work with the imports.\n\n## Examples\nThe frontMatter has 3 entries above. For this one, we'll focus on the first two:\n```\nesm:\n- /Example2.mjs\n- SimpleCart, named1 as n1: /Example2.mjs\n- /Example4.js\n- default as E4: /Example4.js\n- named1Ext: /Example5.js\n```\n\nThe entries get translated as:\n* `import * as Example2 from \"/Example2.mjs\"`\n* `import { SimpleCart, named1 as n1 } from \"/Example2.mjs\"`\n* `import * as Example4 from \"/Example4.js\"` // this is a Vue component, explained in the next section\n* `import { default as E4 } from \"/Example4.js\"` // this is a Vue component, with an alias, explained in the next section\n* `import { named1Ext } from \"/Example5.js\" // this depends on Example4.js\n\nThe last entry depends on \"/Example4.js\", so if \"/Example4.js\" were missing, that line would fail to import. \n\nAs a result, `Example2`, `SimpleCart`, `n1`, and `named1Ext` will then be available for us to work with in the story like so: (be in \"split\" mode to see the input vs. output)\n\n<div v-if=\"!$fetchState.pending\">\n  <json :data=\"Example2\" />\n\n  {{ Example2.fn2() }}\n\n  {{ n1() }}\n\n  <json :data=\"SimpleCart\" />\n\n  {{ named1Ext() }}\n</div>\n\nIf Example2.mjs were to have any changes, and we wanted to re-fetch those changes without doing a hard refresh, we could simply do so by appending a query parameter to the URL to invalidate the browser cache:\n\n* If we specified: \"/Example2.mjs?v=2\" or \"/Example2.mjs?t=[timeNow]\", we'd retrieve the newer version of Example2. And, if we were to remove that query parameter, we'd retrieve the older version from browser cache very quickly, all without having to perform a relatively slower refresh.\n\n## Caveats\n\nAs mentioned in the parent story \"Dynamic Import\", Example2.mjs can only include absolute or relative URLs, and those resources have to exist. Module names alone do not get resolved by the browser; that kind of name resolution has always been handled for you by your bundler, such as webpack. Hand elpful tip: Also, when working with browser import statements, usually the full filename with the extension has to be provided. \n\n# Importing Vue (.mjs)\n\nIn addition to importing the ESM files into the story, if the ESM exports a default object with a \".render\" function, that object will be assumed to be a Vue component and registered as such. The filename will be used as the component name, unless an alias is specified. In that case, the alias will be used as the component name. \n\n## Examples\nLet's look at the relevant ESM entries:\n\n```\nesm:\n- /Example4.js\n- default as E4: /Example4.js\n```\n\nIt should be known that \"/Example4.js\" has a default export containing a defined render function. Therefore, in addition to being able to work with Example4's exports, we can also just use the default export as a Vue component. \n\nSo, the first entry means to register \"Example4\" as a Vue component, and the second one means to register E4 as a Vue component. Both entries specify the same resource, so below, we should see to identical components (but with separate state):\n\n<div v-if=\"!$fetchState.pending\">\nHere is \"Example4\" Vue component:\n<Example4 />\n\nHere is \"E4\" Vue component\": (it should look the same as \"Example4\" but have its own state)\n<E4 />\n<div>\n\n## Caveats\n\nThe Vue components to be imported need to already be .js or .mjs. If they are .vue files, there is no vue-loader here to transpile the file into .js. On the bright-side though, depending on how simple the Vue component is, you may actually find writing, maintaining and testing the component in .js is far easier.\n\n# How it works \n\nFirst, the frontMatter is inspected for changes to either frontMatter.esm or frontMatter.npm (npm explained in next section). Only if changes have occurred will the following take place.\n\n1. Construct an importer script by parsing the entries. Append to that script a callback when imports are ready. The callbacks will be a Vuex mutation (to \"$nuxtStories/ESMS_FETCHED\") and a \"modsImported\" method attached to the DOM element containing the importer script. The callbacks consume the imports.\n2. Find the DOM element with id \"nuxt-stories-esm\". If it does not exist, create it with its contents set to the importer script. If it does exist, simply replace the element with the updated importer. \n3. Append this importer element to `document.head`. \n","toc":[{"type":"heading","raw":"# Importing ESM (.mjs)\n\n","depth":1,"text":"Importing ESM (.mjs)","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Importing ESM (.mjs)","text":"Importing ESM (.mjs)"}],"href":"#importing-esm-mjs"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Examples\n","depth":2,"text":"Examples","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Examples","text":"Examples"}],"href":"#examples"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Caveats\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Caveats","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Caveats","text":"Caveats"}],"href":"#caveats"},{"type":"heading","raw":"# Importing Vue (.mjs)\n\n","depth":1,"text":"Importing Vue (.mjs)","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Importing Vue (.mjs)","text":"Importing Vue (.mjs)"}],"href":"#importing-vue-mjs"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Examples\n","depth":2,"text":"Examples","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Examples","text":"Examples"}],"href":"#examples"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Caveats\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Caveats","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Caveats","text":"Caveats"}],"href":"#caveats"},{"type":"heading","raw":"# How it works \n\n","depth":1,"text":"How it works","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"How it works","text":"How it works"}],"href":"#how-it-works"}],"md":"\n# Importing ESM (.mjs)\n\nMost modern browsers support importing absolute and relative URLs, and a modern browser must be used for the import to work correctly.

On the bright-side though, depending on how simple the Vue component is, you may actually find writing, maintaining and testing the component in .js is far easier.\n\n# How it works \n\nFirst, the frontMatter is inspected for changes to either frontMatter.esm or frontMatter.npm (npm explained in next section). Only if changes have occurred will the following take place.\n\n1. Construct an importer script by parsing the entries. Append to that script a callback when imports are ready. The callbacks will be a Vuex mutation (to \"$nuxtStories/ESMS_FETCHED\") and a \"modsImported\" method attached to the DOM element containing the importer script. The callbacks consume the imports.\n2. Find the DOM element with id \"nuxt-stories-esm\". If it does not exist, create it with its contents set to the importer script. If it does exist, simply replace the element with the updated importer. \n3. Append this importer element to `document.head`. \n","compiled":"<h1 id=\"importing-esm-mjs\">Importing ESM (.mjs)</h1>\n<p>Most modern browsers support importing absolute and relative URLs, and a modern browser must be used for the import to work correctly. To import ES modules (.mjs or .js files that use the ESM syntax), the <code>frontMatter.esm</code> property needs to be defined and formatted as an array of either URLs or importName-to-URL map entry. In fact, the importName-to-URL map entry is exactly what you would type in your import statements in an ESM file (nuxt-stories merely encapsulates curly braces around your entry, so &quot;as [alias]&quot; will also work). </p>\n<p>If the entry is a URL, then all scripts in that file will be imported as the script name. If the entry is an importName-to-URL map, then the named imports will be imported from the specified URL, provided the module at that URL exports those names. Again, if &quot;as [alias]&quot; is provided, the import will be available to work with as that alias. </p>\n<p>All the fetching is performed in Nuxt&#39;s fetch hook, so it&#39;s advised to check <code>$fetchState.pending</code> before attempting to work with the imports.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples\">Examples</h2>\n<p>The frontMatter has 3 entries above. For this one, we&#39;ll focus on the first two:</p>\n<pre><code class=\" hljs\">esm:\n- /Example2.mjs\n- SimpleCart, named1 as n1: /Example2.mjs\n- /Example4.js\n- default as E4: /Example4.js\n- named1Ext: /Example5.js</code></pre><p>The entries get translated as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>import * as Example2 from &quot;/Example2.mjs&quot;</code></li>\n<li><code>import { SimpleCart, named1 as n1 } from &quot;/Example2.mjs&quot;</code></li>\n<li><code>import * as Example4 from &quot;/Example4.js&quot;</code> // this is a Vue component, explained in the next section</li>\n<li><code>import { default as E4 } from &quot;/Example4.js&quot;</code> // this is a Vue component, with an alias, explained in the next section</li>\n<li>`import { named1Ext } from &quot;/Example5.js&quot; // this depends on Example4.js</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last entry depends on &quot;/Example4.js&quot;, so if &quot;/Example4.js&quot; were missing, that line would fail to import. </p>\n<p>As a result, <code>Example2</code>, <code>SimpleCart</code>, <code>n1</code>, and <code>named1Ext</code> will then be available for us to work with in the story like so: (be in &quot;split&quot; mode to see the input vs. output)</p>\n<div v-if=\"!$fetchState.pending\">\n  <json :data=\"Example2\" />\n\n<p>  {{ Example2.fn2() }}</p>\n<p>  {{ n1() }}</p>\n  <json :data=\"SimpleCart\" />\n\n<p>  {{ named1Ext() }}</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If Example2.mjs were to have any changes, and we wanted to re-fetch those changes without doing a hard refresh, we could simply do so by appending a query parameter to the URL to invalidate the browser cache:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we specified: &quot;/Example2.mjs?v=2&quot; or &quot;/Example2.mjs?t=[timeNow]&quot;, we&#39;d retrieve the newer version of Example2. And, if we were to remove that query parameter, we&#39;d retrieve the older version from browser cache very quickly, all without having to perform a relatively slower refresh.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>As mentioned in the parent story &quot;Dynamic Import&quot;, Example2.mjs can only include absolute or relative URLs, and those resources have to exist. Module names alone do not get resolved by the browser; that kind of name resolution has always been handled for you by your bundler, such as webpack. Hand elpful tip: Also, when working with browser import statements, usually the full filename with the extension has to be provided. </p>\n<h1 id=\"importing-vue-mjs\">Importing Vue (.mjs)</h1>\n<p>In addition to importing the ESM files into the story, if the ESM exports a default object with a &quot;.render&quot; function, that object will be assumed to be a Vue component and registered as such. The filename will be used as the component name, unless an alias is specified. In that case, the alias will be used as the component name. </p>\n<h2 id=\"examples-1\">Examples</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s look at the relevant ESM entries:</p>\n<pre><code class=\" hljs\">esm:\n- /Example4.js\n- default as E4: /Example4.js</code></pre><p>It should be known that &quot;/Example4.js&quot; has a default export containing a defined render function. Therefore, in addition to being able to work with Example4&#39;s exports, we can also just use the default export as a Vue component. </p>\n<p>So, the first entry means to register &quot;Example4&quot; as a Vue component, and the second one means to register E4 as a Vue component. Both entries specify the same resource, so below, we should see to identical components (but with separate state):</p>\n<div v-if=\"!$fetchState.pending\">\nHere is \"Example4\" Vue component:\n<Example4 />\n\n<p>Here is &quot;E4&quot; Vue component&quot;: (it should look the same as &quot;Example4&quot; but have its own state)\n<E4 /></p>\n<div>\n\n<h2 id=\"caveats-1\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>The Vue components to be imported need to already be .js or .mjs.
