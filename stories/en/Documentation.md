# Getting Started

<Readme />

--- 

# Did you notice?

Nuxt-stories was used to see how the `<Readme />` component would render the README.md file. The story for it were written in the [Readme story](/stories/en/Library/Components/Readme)

ALSO...it's reusable. So any project that has a README can just insert that component and get a HTML marked-up version of that on their own websites :)
