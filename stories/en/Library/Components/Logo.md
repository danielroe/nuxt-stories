# Design

The logo represents what Nuxt Stories is: the bringing together of stories (requirements), functional code, and tests...all in one place! That's what the glowing triangle is in the middle, FYI.

Clicking on the logo when it sits in the header shall navigate to the stories root (which in this case is /stories/en/)
