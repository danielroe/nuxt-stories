# Date 12-16-2021

* [ ] Re-add the story factory features
  - [ ] Fetch
  - [ ] Node-fetch
  - [ ] Dynamic import
* [ ] Update tests (and perhaps use this time to tinker with test-scaffolding)

# Nice to have 

* Quick components for common embeds:
  - Youtube. I.e., `<youtube video=[id] />` instead of the lengthy Iframe codes.
* Perhaps a "design mode" that lets each HTML tag in the viewer get styled and then have those styles back-saved. I know chrome dev tools lets the FS be loaded, but it's still in the drawer or to the side. I think I'd go faster if the styling tool were on the UI.

# Old Items

1. All tracked issues are in [github](https://github.com/richardeschloss/nuxt-stories/issues)
2. Would be nice to make the placeholder items functional
  - [x] Search box
  - [x] Lang 
  - [ ] ~~User~~
3. Would be nice to have a "knobs" / "actions" feature 
4. Footer for navigating prev / next stories.
5. Would be nice to have tests get auto-scaffolded based on the stories. Perhaps selecting "jest" or "ava" would rapidly scaffold the tests.
6. Might be nice to have stories get auto-generated for components that currently exist in the components dir. (I think? Or would synching all that be a pain?)
7. Update meta tags (and og:image) for this deployed app.
8. As mentionned in github issues, these are the wishful things: observerablehq integration (?), h-wiki backend (?).
