# Todo Items

1. All tracked issues are in [github](https://github.com/richardeschloss/nuxt-stories/issues)
1. Would be nice to make the placeholder items functional; i.e., search box, lang, user.
1. Would be nice to have a "knobs" / "actions" feature 
1. Footer for navigating prev / next stories.
1. Would be nice to have tests get auto-scaffolded based on the stories. Perhaps selecting "jest" or "ava" would rapidly scaffold the tests.
1. Might be nice to have stories get auto-generated for components that currently exist in the components dir. (I think? Or would synching all that be a pain?)
1. Update meta tags (and og:image) for this deployed app.
1. As mentionned in github issues, these are the wishful things: observerablehq integration (?), h-wiki backend (?).
1. bootstrap-vue has a patch for router-link deprecation warnings. That will be updated when it's released.
1. bootstrap-vue source map 404 errors appear in devtools ([6944](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/6944) seems to have some workarounds)
