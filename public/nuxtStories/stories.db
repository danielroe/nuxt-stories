It will only be enabled if your environment is development OR if you specify `forceBuild: true`. There might be times where you want to host the app as a static site so that you can also share the stories. However, normally in production, you probably wouldn't want to package them.\n\n```js\n...\nbuildModules: [\n  [ 'nuxt-stories', { forceBuild: false } ]\n]\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also specify the stories options separately:\n```js\n...\nbuildModules: ['nuxt-stories'],\nstories: { /* stories options here */ }\n...\n```\n\n## Module Options\n\n| option | description | default |\n|---|---|---|\n| `forceBuild` | Force the creation of story routes | false |\n| `lang` | stories language | 'en' |\n| `storiesDir` | Stories Directory | 'stories' |\n| `storiesAnchor` | Stories Route Root | `storiesDir` value |\n| `ioOpts` | socket.io server options | See below |\n| `staticHost` | static host options | See below |\n| `fetch` | fetch feature enable, see [Fetching Data](/stories/en/Documentation/Fetching%20Data) | true |\n| `watchStories` | enables filesystem watching of stories | `!staticHost` |\n| `inputDebounceMs` | Debounce time for the text input to the editor | 350 ms |\n| `titleDebounceMs` | Debounce time for renaming the story when the frontmatter title is changed | 700 ms |  \n\n\n### IO Options\n\nBy default, if a static host is not specified, the nuxt-stories module will start a socket.io server and will add a special \"nuxtStories\" socket.io client when your app starts up. The IO server is used to respond requests from the client to perform the following actions:\n\n- Add story\n- Rename story\n- Remove story\n- Fetch story\n- Fetch all stories\n- Saving markdown-based story\n\nThe CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) features only work properly for Markdown-first stories. They haven't been designed to work for Vue-first stories, and it is not planned to support Vue-first, since I think most users will go with Markdown-first.\n\nThe IO options takes the following options:\n\n| option | description | default |\n|---|---|---|\n| host | socket.io hostname | Nuxt app's hostname (localhost) |\n| port | socket.io port | Nuxt app's port + 1 (3001) |\n| url | socket.io url | undefined |\n\nIf you provide the socket.io url, any provided host or port will be ignored. The url provided will be used.\n\nThere is no need to specify the socket.io client. Under the hood, the nuxt-stories module will register the IO server and know how to auto setup the socket.io client using nuxt-socket-io. \n\nWhen the IO options are used, the CRUD operations will be accessed in a dropdown that appears when you hover over the stories, but always hidden if a static host were specified (see next sections)\n\n### Static Host Options\n\nIf the `staticHost` options are truthy, all socket.io features will not be registered. This can be useful if you wish to create documents that you don't want others to change; i.e., you want the content to be *static* (and unchanged). Therefore, if staticHost is truthy, all the CRUD features for stories won't be registered, and when you hover over the stories in the sidebar, no CRUD dropdown will appear (as designed). \n\nThe following are options for the static host: (pick one)\n\n| option | description | default |\n|---|---|---|\n| mount | the static mount point for stories | '/markdown' |\n| url | api endpoint for stories | undefined | \n\nThe mount point or the url is where you expect the stories to be. It'll either be at:\n\n1. [your host][mount]/stories.json\n\nor\n\n2. [your url] // some url that returns stories JSON.\n\nYou can either specify the mount point or the url. If you specify both, the url will be used. \n But, by default, if `staticHost` is truthy (i.e., in the simplest form `true`), then the mount point will be '/markdown'. This mount point will statically serve the content in your stories directory (\"stories\" by default). \n\nIf you are using the defaults, the nuxt-stories module will automatically scan your stories directory to build the following stories.json file that can then easily be fetched:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"en\": {\n    name: 'stories'\n    path: '...',\n    children: [...]\n  },\n  \"es\": {\n    name: 'stories'\n    path: '...',\n    children: [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt's simply a JSON grouped by language. This file in [stories directory] will then be accessible at [mount point]: '/markdown/stories.json'. \n\nIf instead of providing a mount point, you provide a url that is something completely external (and out of your control), you just need to make sure that url provides stories.json in the correct format:\n\n```js\n{ \n  [language]: Story\n}\n```\n\nWhere each story has a schema:\n\n```js\n{\n  name: String, /* Story name */\n  path: String, /* Route path */\n  idxs: [Number], /* Array of idxs that trace to this story (see below) */\n  mdPath: String /* Story's relative markdown path */\n  children: [Story]\n}\n```\n\nThe idxs help make it easier to navigate to each story, even after changing the order on the UI. For example, consider the following tree:\n\n* story 1\n  * child 1\n* story 2\n  * child 1\n\nStory 1's \"child1\" would have idxs [0, 0], whereas story 2's \"child1\" would have idxs [1, 0]. Then, if the UI were after to change the order of the stories, it'd be easy to refer to the right \"child1\" by using those idxs.\n\n\n\n","toc":[{"type":"heading","raw":"## Configuration\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Configuration","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Configuration","text":"Configuration"}],"href":"#configuration"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Module Options\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Module Options","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Module Options","text":"Module Options"}],"href":"#module-options"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### IO Options\n\n","depth":3,"text":"IO Options","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"IO Options","text":"IO Options"}],"href":"#io-options"},{"type":"heading","raw":"### Static Host Options\n\n","depth":3,"text":"Static Host Options","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Static Host Options","text":"Static Host Options"}],"href":"#static-host-options"}],"md":"\n## Configuration\n\nIn your `nuxt.config.js` file, just specify `nuxt-stories` as one of your `buildModules`.

It will respect two properties \"fetch\" and \"nodeFetch\" in the frontMatter. The syntax for both is identical, with the main difference being *where* the fetch is initiated: client or server.\n\nIn addition to fetching data, the feature also allows you to instantly parse the data and redirect the fetched to browser storage depending on the syntax you provide.\n\nThe most basic format is this:\n\n```html\n---\n  fetch:\n    [prop1]: [path or url] [| format?] [> [dest?]]\n  nodeFetch:\n    [prop2]: [path or url] [| format?] [> [dest?]]\n---\n```\n\nThe results will be merged into a property \"fetched\" that will contain the responses. The response will also be stored in vuex so other stories can easily access it.\n\nThe supported formats are: \n* text - default\n* csv \n* json\n* xml\n\nThe supported destinations are:\n* localStorage (alias \"lS\")\n* sessionStorage (alias \"sS\")\n\n## Fetch example\n\nIn this story, the frontMatter contains:\n```html\n  fetch: \n    csv: /someFile.csv | csv\n    someJson: /someJson.json | json > lS\n```\n\nTo analyze this line-by-line, this means to:\n\n1. Fetch \"/someFile.csv\", then parse the response as csv (with the \"| csv\") and store the json result in this component's fetched (`this.fetched.csv`).\nHere is the response: \n\n> Input: {{ fetched.csvIn }}\n\n> Output: {{ fetched.csv }}\n\n2. Fetch \"/someJson.json\", then parse the response as json (with the \"| json\"), store the json result in `this.fetched.someJson` and then also send that response to localStorage (with the \"> lS\", using the alias):\n\n> Input: {{ fetched.someJsonIn }}\n\n> Output: {{ fetched.someJson }}\n\n> Also stored in: (remove ticks to see it)\n\n`{{` localStorage.fetched[$route.path] `}}`\n\n## Node fetch example\n\nNOTE: this only works with a running server. I.e., it won't work on static deploys.\n\nThis story's frontMatter also contains the following nodeFetch entries:\n\n```html\n  nodeFetch:\n    someJson2: /someJson.json | json > sS\n```\n\nIt is important to note that the responses from both `fetch` and `nodeFetch` get merged into a single `this.fetched` object, so the property names need to be unique. Since `fetch` already specified \"someJson\", we can't re-use that in `nodeFetch`. We have to give it a unique name, for example \"someJson2\".\n\nIn this example, it's very similar to the one before, but instead of sending the response to localStorage, we send it to sessionStorage (using the alias \"sS\").\n\n> You can see it below: (remove tick marks)\n\n`{{` sessionStorage.fetched `}}`\n\nAlso, as a convenience to the user, while node-fetch normally requires the hostname to be provided, the nuxt-stories plugin handles this for you. If you provide relative path, it will prepend `window.location.origin` to satisfy node-fetch's requirement.\n\n## Parametric fetch\n\nThere are times when the routes are parametric. I.e., `/path/to/search?id=:productId&count=:count`\n\nThere are also times where the parameters to provide are not defined on the component, but are defined in environment variables, such as API keys: `/getData?apiKey=$API_KEY`\n\nThe nuxt-stories module supports both kinds of routes. Consider the following frontMatter:\n\n```html\n---\n  productId: 123\n  count: 5\n  fetch:\n    list: /path/to/search?id=:productId&count=:count\n  nodeFetch:\n    myResp: /myData?apiKey=$API_KEY\n---\n```\n\nThe following will take place:\n1. On the client, \":productId\" and \":count\" will be replaced by this component's `productId` and `count`, respectively. So the fetch request will go to: `/path/to/search?id=123&count=5`. The result will be stored in `this.list`\n\n2. On the server, \"$API_KEY\" will be replaced by process.env[API_KEY], and so that environment variable will need to be defined when the server is running. The fetch will request `/myData?apiKey=[process.env[API_KEY]]` and the result will also stored in `this.myResp`.\n\n## Fetching with Options\n\nThis module also allows [fetch options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#parameters) to be wired to the underlying fetch API using the property `fetchOpts` in the frontMatter. There are times where certain resources require HTTP headers to also be sent with the request. This is where fetchOpts comes into play:\n\n```html\n  fetch:\n    resp1: somehost.com/path/needs/opts\n    resp2: somehost.com/path/also/needs/opts\n    resp3: someOtherHost.com/needs/opts\n  fetchOpts:\n    resp1: \n      headers:\n        cookie: abc123\n    resp2: \n      headers:\n        cookie: abc123\n    resp3:\n      mode: no-cors\n```  \n\nThe fetchOpts needs to have the same property names as the fetch or nodeFetch objects, so that the module knows what option set to send to a specific route. So, in the snippet above, the fetchOpts would get sent to each route. `someHost.com` would get the cookie \"abc123\", whereas `someOtherHost.com` would receive no cookies, the fetch API would consume the \"mode: no-cors\" options for that endpoint.\n\nThe above can get quite tedious to write, so as an initial convenience, option sets can be aliased with a string prefixed with \":\" like this:\n\n```html\n  someHostOpts:\n    headers:\n      cookie: abc123\n  fetch:\n    resp1: somehost.com/path/needs/opts\n    resp2: somehost.com/path/also/needs/opts\n    resp3: someOtherHost.com/needs/opts\n  fetchOpts:\n    resp1: \":someHostOpts\"\n    resp2: \":someHostOpts\"\n    resp3:\n      mode: no-cors\n``` \n\nHere, `someHostOpts` is now defined on the component and can be re-used with \":someHostOpts\" in the \"fetchOpts\" frontMatter.\n\n## Accessing from Vuex\n\nAs mentioned before, all the responses are contained in this components `this.fetched` object. This actually is a computed property, which simply pulls from the Vuex store, keying off the current route `$route.path`. Therefore, if any other story needs to access what was fetched in one story, it can with `$store.state.$nuxtStories.fetched[story relative path]`:\n\n{{ $store.state.$nuxtStories.fetched }}","toc":[{"type":"heading","raw":"# Fetching Data\n\n","depth":1,"text":"Fetching Data","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Fetching Data","text":"Fetching Data"}],"href":"#fetching-data"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Fetch example\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Fetch example","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Fetch example","text":"Fetch example"}],"href":"#fetch-example"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Node fetch example\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Node fetch example","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Node fetch example","text":"Node fetch example"}],"href":"#node-fetch-example"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Parametric fetch\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Parametric fetch","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Parametric fetch","text":"Parametric fetch"}],"href":"#parametric-fetch"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Fetching with Options\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Fetching with Options","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Fetching with Options","text":"Fetching with Options"}],"href":"#fetching-with-options"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Accessing from Vuex\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Accessing from Vuex","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Accessing from Vuex","text":"Accessing from Vuex"}],"href":"#accessing-from-vuex"}],"md":"\n# Fetching Data\n\nA special fetch feature is introduced and enabled by default in v2.0.13 of nuxt-stories.

This tool strives to help you and your stakeholders communicate requirements much more efficiently. Having stories that also contain your *functional components* will make it crystal clear what the web app does. Plus, if you use a version control system such as git, you can quickly change branches to see different versions of stories/layouts/whatever.\n\nIf you've heard of popular patterns such as \"Test Driven Development\" or \"Behavior Driven Development\", you may want to consider \"Story Driven Development\". If you've ever been at a bar or campfire with friends, it's common to hear \"I gotta a great app idea for xyz, it would be great if it did 1, 2, 3...\", but at the same time, no one ever acts on that because they don't have the tool (well, maybe only 10% of people actually do something about it). Now, with the right development tool, you can quickly jot down the stories asap and get the web app wired up faster than ever. \n\nSince development speed is a priority, this means the module aims to be something that is relatively quick to install and configure. One-line in nuxt.config and you're set! No more dreadful weekends to set aside for this crap!\n\n## nuxt-stories vs storybookjs\n\nThere is a lot that's cool about storybookjs. If you're already in the REACT world, it's probably the ideal solution. Storybook is REACT-centric, which attempts to make itself pluggable into Angular, Vue and other front-end frameworks, but from my experience, it was more complicated than I wanted it to be. Whenever I wanted \"vue storybookjs\", I had to download the boatload of react dependencies. I wanted to keep things much more lightweight.

The content will either be just the editor, just the viewer or both. To simplify the layout, the CSS grid is used, specifying grid columns \"1fr 1fr\" when in split view, and only \"1fr\" other cases. \n\nBoth the editor and viewer components take \"story\" (the active story) as a prop.\n\n## Editor\n\nThe editor starts out as a `<div>` with its content set to that of the active story. On `mouseenter` it becomes a `<textarea>` input so that we can edit the content *easily* (even though a div can have a \"contenteditable\" attribute, that attribute is deprecate and causes the div to have issues when dealing with whitespace and new lines). The reason for still using a div however, is to greatly facility the scrolling to specific sections. \n\nThe scrolling feature in the editor works as follows. The current $route hash determines what section needs to be scrolled to. While `String.prototype.match` can tell us the index of the match, the cursor within a textarea element can't tell us the xy-position of that cursor on the screen. Therefore, the textarea has to be changed into a div that has three children:\n1. the text before match\n2. a dummy [empty] cursor element at the match\n3. the remaining text  \n\nThis way, we get the cursor exactly at the point we want, and only need it's y-position to determine how much to move the scroll bar. \n\nThe editor's scrolling only works when it's a div. Therefore, it starts out as a div, and returns to being a div on `mouseleave` events (which would happen if the user clicks one of the table-of-contents links or updates the URL). \n\nWhen the editor is a `<textarea />` and the user types input, the following happens:\n1. If we're not on a static host, the changes get communicated back to the server (and the changes are automatically saved)\n2. The content associated with the active story gets updated in Vuex (so dependents, like the viewer and sidenav, get notified and can work with the updates). The sidenav in particular will update when the `frontMatter.order` has changed.\n\nIt's possible that the user is making changes to the content on the filesystem. Since we are watching for those changes, when those changes occur, they'll be reflected in the editor. (Guards are put in place to check if the input is from user typing in the textarea vs. saving the file in a different editor).\n\nThe frontMatter is very powerful can become more powerful in the future. Today, changing the title will quickly rename the story; this is actually faster than renaming it in the sidebar.\n\nThe following debounce times are in place:\n* `inputDebounceMs` - to measure if we're actively typing. (default: 350ms; every 350ms, any input that is typed will reset the timer and start it over. 350 ms after no input, the timer will be cleared)\n* `titleDebounceMs` - time to wait before renaming the title (default: 750 ms; if we're still editing the title, don't rename the story until 750 ms has passed after our last keystroke)\n\n## Viewer\n\nThe viewer displays the compiled content. Specifically, it implements this pipeline:\n\n* Content --> Compile Markdown --> Compile Vue --> Extend Compiled Vue with Story features\n\nIt makes use of the following utilities to make the pipeline work:\n\n| Utility | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| utils/markdown.js | First parses out the frontMatter with [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) (note: gray-matter requires `Buffer` to be polyfilled). Then it also provides the table of contents and compiled markdown as HTML *markup*. Even though table of contents is parsed out, it's not used in the viewer.

Using a Story Factory lets us expand on the kinds of features we want to add in the future  |\n\n### Auto scrolling feature\n\nThe viewer does two important things: \n1. It auto scrolls to the header matching the current $route.hash (but note: headers have to be unique for this to work! headers are \"id\"s).\n2. It *observes* the scrolling (using [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)) so that as we scroll from one section to the next we can: update the $route hash, scroll the editor, and update the active header in the table of contents.\n\n\n# Demo\n\nYou're using it right this second 😊\n\n# Future consideration\n\nIt may be desired to have a rich-text editor on the viewer, which would also update the styles.

I want those applications to aggregate information and display that information in a manner that suits my specific personal preferences. I want those applications to just work and be easy to maintain. But, if I think of every application as a collection of components strung together, it's really perfectly ironed out components I want that are easy to design, tweak and reuse anytime.\n\nMy existing workflow for solving problems is flawed. It might involve manual data entry into outdated spreadsheets, or manually navigating to multiple websites for information I want, or jumping in and out of mobile apps. The workflow is made even slower when those websites don't prioritize the delivery of content.\n\nThere has to be a better way. I envision a set of stories that use only the components I specify. In fact, my ideal way to write an application is to simply write the components it uses. For example:\n\n```\n<App>\n  <NutritionData food=\"Apple\" />\n  <Recipes food=\"Apple\" sortBy=\"price\" />  \n</App>\n```\n\nSo yes, while each of these components will ultimately need to specify HTML tags, I only want to think of them when I've reached the lowest level of that particular component; i.e., at the point `<NutritionData />` needs a table, that's when the HTML `<table />` tag finally comes in. \n\n\nThe reader might ask, what do these components look like? Where do they get placed?  Well, that's where the stories come in. \n\n\nTo me, it makes the most sense to jot my notes and thoughts down in markdown, since it's the fastest way I can write in a somewhat organized way (and use a markdown viewer to see those notes in a pretty way instantly). But, I want to take it a step further and see the actual component running in my story so I can see right away if it's working and looking correctly. \n\nSo, if I'm designing a component, my story might look something like:\n\n\"The `<NutritionData />` component shall display the nutrition data for the provided food item. It will default to \"Apple\" if no food is specified. \"\n\nAnd then be able to see the component right away if I type the component without the ` marks. So maybe on first glance, that component would be an un-styled empty table, but then as the component gets developed, the story would show the updated view.\n\nTo develop components, it's useful to be able to feed those components dummy data, because the goal first is to style it accordingly (because we know the real data is just an API call away, but we don't want to get bogged down by those API requests and waiting for that data). Even the choice of API provider can become a story point. \n\nIf possible, I would design the components directly on the UI, and have those styles get immediately saved back on the filesystem. At the least, I need to my notes to get saved as I type them. It's a win-win when I can quickly *write* notes in a somewhat messy fashion, but then quickly read them back in a beautiful way. No fussing around with UI controls like \"B\" or \"*I*\", just type and be done with it.\n\nI want the application to be *mine* and *ours*. I guess it's the developer and designer within me. So even if it can be argued that \"a nutrition app exists\", it doesn't necessarily meet the look-and-feel I want. I don't want to wait for *those developers* to make changes when I can empower myself to do it myself today. \n\nLastly, I realized that I greatly underestimated the need for content search and quick navigation. So, not only do I require a fast way to look up my buried thoughts, I need to get to the exact section on my mind instantly. This means having a search that highlights the matched word in context of the found searches. It means having a table-of-contents that navigates to the exact section of interest quickly (and with a smooth animation so I know something is going on).  \n\n## What I do not want\n\n* When I make changes to code or to styles, I don't want wait forever to see the changes on the UI. I want to see the changes quickly. \n\n* I don't want to have to keep clicking the document reload button or having the app do it. I just want to go to the desired route *now* and not wait for the entire DOM tree to load! I know I can do better. \n\n* DevTools in the drawer or separate screen can be useful, but if possible, I want to avoid the need to switch between the tools and the application. Sometimes I want to inspect an element or component without having to drill down to it each time. Same goes for global state. I'd rather just map the state used by a given component, and see that, rather than drilling through all of Vuex. (But, there are times where I'm glad I have Vue devTools so that I can see the full state!)\n\n* I don't want to be limited to a small set of controls, styles, tools, fonts, whatever. The INTERNET is global and filled with resources and growing. I want my design palette to feel infinite. This means, when it comes to styling my components, I'm not limited to \"text-white\" or \"text-primary\", but I can use a color picker that easily lets me pick colors and gradients. If there's a component that exists on Bit or NPM, I would want to be able to quickly download and use it (and understand, my standard for \"quick\". I want really fast).\n\n* I don't want to pigeonhole myself into one framework vs. another. Even if I really love the framework, the way I think about applications I'm thinking about the components I need, and I try to write those components in somewhat a framework-agnostic way (although, frameworks offer features that make it difficult to really be agnostic). \n\n* I don't want my testing procedures to slow me down, but rather speed them up. Normally, automated testing does make me go faster, but usually only when a UI is not involved. Once the UI testing is needed, the testing process is not a joy at all. It's a lot of boilerplate code and scaffolding that slows me (and all of us) down. It would be better to have those tests scaffolded when the stories are written, so that they are ready to go. Whether it's jest, ava or testing right in the browser, I'm not exactly sure what I want the implementation to be, but at a simple level, suppose we have a story point:\n\n\"Clicking the Refresh button shall refresh the list of recipes\". \n\nIn a testing framework, this looks like:\n\n* Ava\n\n```js\ntest('Refresh recipes button', (t) => {\n  const recipeList = new RecipeList() \n  recipeList.$el.querySelector('#refresh')\n  t.true(/* some condition */)\n})\n```\n\nJest\n\n```js\nit('Refresh recipes button', () => {\n  const recipeList = new RecipeList() \n  recipeList.$el.querySelector('#refresh')\n  expect(/* some condition */)\n})\n```\n\nIn both the above cases, see what drag it is to write a test just for a button click? Not shown is the boilerplate needed to set up the DOM because those tests generally run in node, not the browser. So the tests have to wait for JSDOM to fire up. Perhaps it would make us more productive to just run the tests in the browser and report the results and coverage (implementation details to be thought about...). \n\n## Where stories can live\n\n\nIt depends what I'm building. If I'm building a library, that library will have documentation written for it, and I'll want to host that documentation to some static site. I.e., that documentation would just be a static hosted version of the stories I write. If there has been a major set of features released worth discussing, that's when I like to publish an article about it on popular websites such as Medium.com or dev.to. But really, I think I'd be more helpful to the reader if I just published the working stories. This way, the reader could just try out features in the browser and tweak \n\n\nAt the same time though, as I'm building my library and its UI components, \n\n","toc":[{"type":"heading","raw":"# My Ideal Workflow\n\n\n","depth":1,"text":"My Ideal Workflow","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"My Ideal Workflow","text":"My Ideal Workflow"}],"href":"#my-ideal-workflow"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## What I want\n","depth":2,"text":"What I want","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"What I want","text":"What I want"}],"href":"#what-i-want"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## What I do not want\n\n","depth":2,"text":"What I do not want","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"What I do not want","text":"What I do not want"}],"href":"#what-i-do-not-want"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## Where stories can live\n\n\n","depth":2,"text":"Where stories can live","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Where stories can live","text":"Where stories can live"}],"href":"#where-stories-can-live"}],"md":"\n# My Ideal Workflow\n\n\n## What I want\nI want to be able to develop applications at the speed of thought.

I.e., that documentation would just be a static hosted version of the stories I write. If there has been a major set of features released worth discussing, that&#39;s when I like to publish an article about it on popular websites such as Medium.com or dev.to. But really, I think I&#39;d be more helpful to the reader if I just published the working stories.

Cleaned up the UI and how the SCSS files are organized. It's much cleaner now. The module no longer adds the styles globally, but rather *only* the Nuxt-stories root component imports the styles it needs.\n* Cleaned up the sidebar. Now it does a better job of matching the stories directory tree. It used to be limited to a depth of 2, but now there is no limit. Also, the adding, renaming and deleting of stories is easier. Even changing the title in the frontMatter will rename the story. Can be a timesaver.\n* Deprecated the \"Vue-first\" stories. Only stories written in Markdown will be supported. It's the better way to go! Easier to maintain the code and easier to maintain the stories!\n* Added LokiDB to help with caching of stories and indexing for the full text search feature\n* Added chokidar to watch for changes made to  stories on the filesystem. This way changes on either the UI or the filesystem appear on the UI instantly. \n* Added automated scrolling to sections for both the viewer and editor. The scrolling works whenever the current route's hash changes (and that hash is valid).\n* Made the Language dropdown functional\n* Improved code organization across the board. Many more components were created and code was moved to where it better fit.\n* Removed the stories layout. No longer needed.\n\n## v2.0.17 - 2021-06-16\n### Changed\n- Improved error handling for the autoImport feature.\n\n## v2.0.16 - 2021-05-17\n### Added\n- Cors options wired to socket.io reg.\n\n## v2.0.15 - 2021-03-04\n### Fixed\n- Stories with spaces (stripped HTML entities in paths).\n\n## v2.0.14 - 2021-03-02\n### Added\n- Dynamic import feature. (specify imports in frontMatter)\n- Pretty json viewer\n\n## v2.0.13 - 2021-01-27\n### Added\n- Fetch feature. (fetch and nodeFetch in frontMatter)\n- Improved error handling for on-the-fly compilation errors.\n\n## v2.0.12 - 2021-01-15\n### Fixed\n- Fixed the children paths when parents get renamed\n\n## v2.0.11 - 2021-01-15\n### Fixed\n- b-link behavior with the newest bootstrap-vue\n\n## v2.0.10 - 2021-01-12\n### Fixed\n- Path resolution of routes and stories on Windows\n\n## v2.0.9 - 2020-09-18\n### Fixed\n- Fixed postinstall copying of sample stories\n\n## v2.0.8 - 2020-08-28\n### Fixed\n- Ordering issue of stories\n\n## v2.0.7 - 2020-08-24\n### Added\n- CRUD operations for stories (add, rename, remove)\n- CRUD controls on the UI when the host is running a socket.io server\n\n### Changed\n- Changed how stories are fetched: either from a static host or a vdefault socket.io host\n\n## v2.0.6 - 2020-07-31\n### Changed\n- Upgraded dependencies, including Nuxt to 2.14. So nuxt generate uses the new full static target.\n- Updated nuxt.config to use the new nuxt generate.\n- Ran security audit, addressed the issues.\n\n## v2.0.5 - 2020-07-30\n### Fixed\n- postinstall script only copies sample stories once now\n\n## v2.0.4 - 2020-07-26\n### Changed\n- README.md is back to a hard file. Not a symlink (npm doesn't like that)\n\n## v2.0.3 - 2020-07-26\n### Added\n- A dummy \"hello\" component to this project. Type `<hello />` in the online demo to see it appear. Nothing exciting, just the easiest thing to quickly see. \n\n### Fixed\n- Issue with vue stories missing (i.e., only markdown stories)\n- Issue with generated routes\n\n## v2.0.2 - 2020-07-25\n### Added\n- Notes about dompurity (and recommendations)\n- Setup notes for nuxt-socket-io\n\n### Changed\n- README.md is now a symbolic link to the docs front page. Avoid duplicated efforts\n\n## v2.0.1 - 2020-07-24\n### Added\n- Added to postinstall script to auto-create vuex store and components folder if they don't already exist.\n\n### Changed\n- Upgraded some devDeps to deps so hopefully they get installed with just installing \"nuxt-stories\". If not, the deps were listed on step 1 of the setup docs.\n\n## v2.0.0 - 2020-07-23\n### Added\n- Created a new \"stories\" layout to be used entirely for the stories.\n- Language-specific stories. Stories directory now contains language sub-directories, so the specified language \"lang\" will use the stories for the selected language. Currently \"en\" is default.\n- Added graymatter and highlight.js dependencies for frontmatter and markdown processing.\n- Added Nuxt Stories Logo.\n- Added autoImport of components. The nuxt-stories plugin auto register its components that it uses for the stories UI and also any components in the app's components folder; i.e., it registers \"vnuxt-stories/lib/components\" and \"vappRoot/components\"\n- Added a \"StoryMarkdown\" component that allows insanely fast live-editing of stories right on the UI...in a combined Markdown / Vue! See your stories get compiled insanely fast!\n- Added markdown utilities to support the markdown processing. Easy to reuse\n- Added an IO service that will listen for changes made to the stories on the UI and save those changes back to the filesystem. So you can edit right on the UI and have everything saved automatically. Editing has never been faster! (this IO service can pave the way for future improvements, such as story CRUD operations on the UI)\n- Added tests, tested the unit tests to 100% cov, e2e tests pass too.\n\n### Changed\n- Stuck with Bootstrap for theming, since it includes many icons and utility classes, and is actually far easier to use for storybooking than Tailwind. I redesigned the UI to better match the look and feel of BootstrapVue docs. Similar but not exactly the same.\n- Renamed \"modules\" to \"lib\". The new main file will be \"lib/stories.module.js\"\n- Changed the default stories directory from \".stories\" to \"stories\", since the benefit of hiding the stories directory really wasn't worth much, and made things more difficult to work with. The \"storiesDir\" option is still there if people want to change it.\n- Changed the postinstall script to also copy over assets and layouts so it's easier for the Nuxt app to use.\n- Updated deployed docs.\n\n## v1.0.6 - 2020-01-24\n### Changed\n- Minor change: replaced the `v-compiled` directive with `v-html`\n\n## v1.0.5 - 2020-01-23\n\n### Fixed\n- Issue with markdown.vue component. Changes were not being shown after hot-module-reload, but now they are.\n\n## v1.0.4 - 2020-01-21\n\n### Changed\n- Bumped dev deps \"marked\" and \"dompurify\" to deps.\n\n## v1.0.3 - 2020-01-21\n\n### Added\n- Custom renderer for tables in Markdown feature. It will produce the bootstrap striped table. Easy to modify if needed.\n\n## v1.0.2 - 2020-01-21\n\n### Added\n- Markdown feature. So now, the stories can be mixed markdown and vue components! Pretty rad!\n\n## v1.0.1 - 2019-11-19\n\n### Added\n\n- Improved Test coverage. Now at 100% on both module and plugin\n- Added test utils\n\n### Changed\n\n- Badge dashboard format\n\n## See Also:\n\n[Releases](https://github.com/richardeschloss/nuxt-stories/releases) \n\n","toc":[{"type":"heading","raw":"# Change Log\n","depth":1,"text":"Change Log","tokens":[{"type":"text","raw":"Change Log","text":"Change Log"}],"href":"#change-log"},{"type":"heading","raw":"## v2.5.0 -

Nothing exciting, just the easiest thing to quickly see. \n\n### Fixed\n- Issue with vue stories missing (i.e., only markdown stories)\n- Issue with generated routes\n\n## v2.0.2 - 2020-07-25\n### Added\n- Notes about dompurity (and recommendations)\n- Setup notes for nuxt-socket-io\n\n### Changed\n- README.md is now a symbolic link to the docs front page. Avoid duplicated efforts\n\n## v2.0.1 - 2020-07-24\n### Added\n- Added to postinstall script to auto-create vuex store and components folder if they don't already exist.\n\n### Changed\n- Upgraded some devDeps to deps so hopefully they get installed with just installing \"nuxt-stories\". If not, the deps were listed on step 1 of the setup docs.\n\n## v2.0.0 - 2020-07-23\n### Added\n- Created a new \"stories\" layout to be used entirely for the stories.\n- Language-specific stories. Stories directory now contains language sub-directories, so the specified language \"lang\" will use the stories for the selected language. Currently \"en\" is default.\n- Added graymatter and highlight.js dependencies for frontmatter and markdown processing.\n- Added Nuxt Stories Logo.\n- Added autoImport of components. The nuxt-stories plugin auto register its components that it uses for the stories UI and also any components in the app's components folder; i.e., it registers \"vnuxt-stories/lib/components\" and \"vappRoot/components\"\n- Added a \"StoryMarkdown\" component that allows insanely fast live-editing of stories right on the UI...in a combined Markdown / Vue! See your stories get compiled insanely fast!\n- Added markdown utilities to support the markdown processing. Easy to reuse\n- Added an IO service that will listen for changes made to the stories on the UI and save those changes back to the filesystem. So you can edit right on the UI and have everything saved automatically. Editing has never been faster! (this IO service can pave the way for future improvements, such as story CRUD operations on the UI)\n- Added tests, tested the unit tests to 100% cov, e2e tests pass too.\n\n### Changed\n- Stuck with Bootstrap for theming, since it includes many icons and utility classes, and is actually far easier to use for storybooking than Tailwind. I redesigned the UI to better match the look and feel of BootstrapVue docs. Similar but not exactly the same.\n- Renamed \"modules\" to \"lib\". The new main file will be \"lib/stories.module.js\"\n- Changed the default stories directory from \".stories\" to \"stories\", since the benefit of hiding the stories directory really wasn't worth much, and made things more difficult to work with. The \"storiesDir\" option is still there if people want to change it.\n- Changed the postinstall script to also copy over assets and layouts so it's easier for the Nuxt app to use.\n- Updated deployed docs.\n\n## v1.0.6 - 2020-01-24\n### Changed\n- Minor change: replaced the `v-compiled` directive with `v-html`\n\n## v1.0.5 - 2020-01-23\n\n### Fixed\n- Issue with markdown.vue component. Changes were not being shown after hot-module-reload, but now they are.\n\n## v1.0.4 - 2020-01-21\n\n### Changed\n- Bumped dev deps \"marked\" and \"dompurify\" to deps.\n\n## v1.0.3 - 2020-01-21\n\n### Added\n- Custom renderer for tables in Markdown feature. It will produce the bootstrap striped table. Easy to modify if needed.\n\n## v1.0.2 - 2020-01-21\n\n### Added\n- Markdown feature. So now, the stories can be mixed markdown and vue components! Pretty rad!\n\n## v1.0.1 - 2019-11-19\n\n### Added\n\n- Improved Test coverage. Now at 100% on both module and plugin\n- Added test utils\n\n### Changed\n\n- Badge dashboard format\n\n## See Also:\n\n[Releases](https://github.com/richardeschloss/nuxt-stories/releases) \n\n","compiled":"<h1 id=\"change-log\">Change Log</h1>\n<p>All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"v250---tbd\">v2.5.0 - TBD</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Major change to ESM from commonjs.</li>\n<li>Major UI design changes to scope styles to nuxt-stories and carry in some styles I liked from bootstrap-docs. Cleaned up the UI and how the SCSS files are organized. It&#39;s much cleaner now. The module no longer adds the styles globally, but rather <em>only</em> the Nuxt-stories root component imports the styles it needs.</li>\n<li>Cleaned up the sidebar. Now it does a better job of matching the stories directory tree. It used to be limited to a depth of 2, but now there is no limit. Also, the adding, renaming and deleting of stories is easier. Even changing the title in the frontMatter will rename the story. Can be a timesaver.</li>\n<li>Deprecated the &quot;Vue-first&quot; stories. Only stories written in Markdown will be supported. It&#39;s the better way to go! Easier to maintain the code and easier to maintain the stories!</li>\n<li>Added LokiDB to help with caching of stories and indexing for the full text search feature</li>\n<li>Added chokidar to watch for changes made to  stories on the filesystem. This way changes on either the UI or the filesystem appear on the UI instantly. </li>\n<li>Added automated scrolling to sections for both the viewer and editor. The scrolling works whenever the current route&#39;s hash changes (and that hash is valid).</li>\n<li>Made the Language dropdown functional</li>\n<li>Improved code organization across the board. Many more components were created and code was moved to where it better fit.</li>\n<li>Removed the stories layout. No longer needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"v2017---2021-06-16\">v2.0.17 - 2021-06-16</h2>\n<h3 id=\"changed\">Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved error handling for the autoImport feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"v2016---2021-05-17\">v2.0.16 - 2021-05-17</h2>\n<h3 id=\"added\">Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cors options wired to socket.io reg.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"v2015---2021-03-04\">v2.0.15 - 2021-03-04</h2>\n<h3 id=\"fixed\">Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stories with spaces (stripped HTML entities in paths).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"v2014---2021-03-02\">v2.0.14 - 2021-03-02</h2>\n<h3 id=\"added-1\">Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic import feature.
