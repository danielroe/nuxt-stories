# Design

The breadcrumbs are designed to make it easy to navigate back to relative parts of the story. It splits the current route path into links, leaving the deepest link as just text (indicating that's the story we're on). While we can split the route path by "/", each story already has "labels" attached to it, which we can use to build the breadcrumbs.

# Demo

(Look above). It takes as a prop the current "story"
